ARGD or Automatic Random Generated Drawing is a drawing app. The drawing is generated from number
(pseudo-random) drawing perform by turtle graphic.

This is written by python. Graphic with turtle, GUI with tkinter generated with Random
(All built-in software (new version))

Bug:
Sometime the turtle run off the screen or canvas, it because the movement is over the screen
You can edit by Changing "Movement" or "Repeat" to lower number like 
Movement = random.randint(5, 10) / Repeat = random.randint
Also, sometime buttons and glitch by Rapid click (May also include Rapidly and Repeatly)
So, slow your clicking down, if you face this problems

This is my first project, so the code might be error.

Thanks for playing
